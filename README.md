# Studienprojekt-TE-3
A class is defined by a specific feature of the Tasks as, language, Size, Task Domain. If Tasks are sharing a feature they are part of the same group. 

**Definition: Size classes**
To investigate the impact of the size on the LogMe Score I defined 4 groups of sizes. 

| **Name** | **Datapoint Range**    | **Size**  |
|----------|------------------------|-----------|
| Max      | 7.5k to 10k Datapoints | 562 Tasks |
| large    | 5k to 7.5k Datapoints  | 101 Tasks |
| small    | 2.5 to 5k Datapoints   | 134 Tasks |
| Tiny     | up to 2.5k Datapoints  | 575 Tasks |
